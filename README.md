# Keylogger

The keystroke logger is a program that runs in the background and collects the user's keystrokes.

### I have created this program to show how simple it is and to make everyone aware of their status as potential victims.

## How does it work?

The file, transformed into an executable, is e-mailed to a target. During execution, it can send keystroke logs to a server. In this way, the attacker can gather information.

## How can I protect myself? 
- The first step is to avoid executing files received anonymously.
- Check the sender's identity
- Check the integrity of the file (it may be modified without your sender's knowledge)

## What if I execute him?
- If in doubt, check the programs currently running.
- Stop program
- Delete the malicious file
